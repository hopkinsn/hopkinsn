  <h2>About Me Page</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Nate Hopkins. I am a senior day student at Western Reserve Academy. I am a captain of hockey, but also play lacrosse and very minimally, soccer. My interest in digital fabrication has always been a part of me, but I realized it after many years of hand-fabrication in my childhood. I would try and make all sorts of combinations of my toys and legos to achieve an otherwise unattainable goal. This curiosity has stayed with me until this day when I can digitally do anything I did as a child with my bare hands. I also like having a goal to work towards in general, I do not like learning about random things with no end in sight, therefore this class will sufice this need of mine.
